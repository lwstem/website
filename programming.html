<p>As part of the programming merit badge you get to write several programs.  To help you get started, here are some summer camp friendly ideas that you can consider. Or, if your creativity is flowing, bring your own ideas to camp and help us grow this list! </p>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>eco lodge - automatically create web pages for pictures/turn a laptop, web camera, and motion sensor into a trail camera/record time of day that motion was sensed and plot in excel</li>
<li>aquatics - water temperature sensor (record water temp data throughout week) and process that data in excel</li>
<li>aquatics - put a gps sensor canoe/kayak then write a program to plot data that is collected when the boat gets back</li>
<li>ham radio - write a program to turn rtl-sdr radio into an fm receiver in gnu-radio</li>
<li>ham radio - contribute an improvement to the radio study app project</li>
<li>ham radio - special event frequency coordination chart - generate a spreadsheet based on a template using excel that wil create a frequency coordination chart for hams in the troop whenever a special event comes up </li>
<li>voice recognition - camp assistant:  using .net speech api and a mini vocabulary (for example "when is dinner", "where is the rifle range" etc.) and have it answer the question using text-to-speech.</li>
<li>voice recognition memorization game: the assistant listens to see if you say the 12 points of the scout law in order.  you have to say it clearly enough to be recognized before you can advance and it times how long it took you to get all twelve.  person with fastest time gets a high score.   could also be done for scout motto, scout slogan, possibly even the scout oath (light up each word in succession if it isn't recognized you can't go forward). with a high score for each of the various ones.</li>
<li>data science/machine learning- write a program that suggests merit badges scouts will like using algorithms used on common websites and by collecting data from other scouts at camp -- "if you like this badge, you might also like"</li>
<li>data science/machine learning - write a program to take coordinate grid data of where shots landed on rifle shooting targets, and suggest tips for the shooter to improve based on the pattern observed on the paper (can use machine learning algorithms for this) </li>
<li>Think & Grin - write a program that has a database of clean jokes that have been in boys life over the years and allows scouts to rank how funny they think each joke is</li>
<li>Camp Cam - write an app that takes a picture and then emails that picture to friends back at home</li>
</ul>
